# üöÄ ServeRest - Cypress API Automation üå≤

This is an API automation testing project using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for the [ServeRest](https://serverest.dev/) website.

## üìå About

This project automates test scenarios for the ServeRest API, an application designed for API testing practice. It serves as a practical example of how to use Cypress to interact with endpoints, validate responses, and improve test automation skills.

> Currently, this project **does not** support parallel test execution.
